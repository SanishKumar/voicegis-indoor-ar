# Known seams

Deliberately unfinished work, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a bug. Each
entry says what is incomplete, why it was left, and what finishing it involves.

## Collapsed map labels are computed but not drawn

`resolveCartographicLabels` in `src/engine/floorplanCartography.ts` returns two
lists: `placed` labels that earned drawn text, and `collapsed` candidates that
did not. Collapsing exists so a feature is never silently dropped from the plan
— reference indoor maps keep an unlabelled point as a dot rather than deleting
it.

`FloorplanViewer` currently consumes only `placed`. The `collapsed` list is
produced and discarded, so a label that loses its space still disappears from
the map entirely. The engine behaviour is correct and covered by tests; the
renderer has simply not been wired to it.

Left unfinished on 2026-08-07 when cartography work stopped in favour of proving
localization in a real building. Finishing it means rendering a small
category-coloured dot at each collapsed candidate's anchor, and making those
dots hit-testable so they can be tapped like any other point of interest.

## Localization anchors are surveyed by hand

`buildings/*/source/building.json` carries anchor positions and headings that
were authored, not measured. Before an accuracy report from a real venue means
anything, its anchors must come from a tape measure against two walls, and the
report must state how they were surveyed. A positioning error measured against
an invented anchor measures nothing.

## Wall topology and cartographic theme are display derivations

`src/engine/wallTopology.ts` and `src/engine/cartographicTheme.ts` derive walls
and colour at render time. They are deliberately outside the compiled
VenuePackage, so venue hashes do not change when cartography changes. Anything
that needs walls to be verifiable — occlusion baked into a package, or a
published mesh — would have to move that derivation into the compiler and accept
rehashing every venue.
